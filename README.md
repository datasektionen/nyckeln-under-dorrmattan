# Nyckeln under dörrmattan
Like [login](https://github.com/datasektionen/login) and
[pls](https://github.com/datasektionen/pls), but it always lets you in and
thinks you can do anything.

The login part can be used as a drop in replacement, but it requires no
configuration, and automatically lets everyone in as Ture Teknolog. You
can also write someones kth id on stdin, which will make future login
requests be for that user. Data is then fetched from hodis.

The pls part only works when validating that a user/mandate/token has a given
permission. It can not list the given permissions for someone. If that isn't
goot enough, use the pls in production and log in as someone with enough
privileges, such as the current kassör or d-sys.

To build and run without docker and specifying custom ports:
```
go run . -login-port 1337 -pls-port 1338
```

To build and run with docker using the default ports:
```
docker build . -t nyckeln
docker run -it --rm --name nyckeln \
    -p 7001:7001 -p 7002:7002 nyckeln
```
